# ZI — "Dysnomia Zi" — spin against purchasing power

## In player terms

| | |
|---|---|
| **Spin against your net worth** | ZI re-runs the whole diagnostic chain, then does modular exponentiation against purchasing power — CHO's own holdings counted through the 1:10:40 wallet weighting. The result (Iota) is a "spin": a number that mixes who you are, where you are, and what you're worth. |
| **The integer that feeds the recorder** | RING reads ZI's spin to stamp your "moment" — the ladder's output becomes a per-player memory onchain. |
| **Naming trap** | ZI's `Tethys` variable is the CHO contract itself — distinct from the owner's constellation label "Tethys" (a SHIO address). Two "Cho"s, two "Tethys"es; keep addresses pinned. |

## 2. Role

子 (seed/son): `Spin(waat) → (Iota, Omicron, Omega, Eta)` — recomputes XIE's
Power, then two modExps against `CHOA.Yuan(CHO)` (purchasing power of CHO
itself as the modulus — "spin against purchasing power"), plus
`Eta = CHO.balanceOf(user) ÷ user.Entropy`. Its `Tethys` reference IS the CHO
contract (the owner-list's "Tethys" label for the CHO channel).

## 3. Dependencies

Holds `Choa` + `Tethys` (= CHO, walked out via `Choa.Sei().Chan().Xie().
Xia().Mai().Qi().Zuo().Cho()` at construction). Called by PANG.Push, RING
(via PANG).

## 4. State

`Choa`, `Tethys` — public.

## 5. Functions

<!-- fntable: ZI @ domain/soeng/05_zi.sol -->
<!-- fntable-begin: ZI @ domain/soeng/05_zi.sol -->
Function table extracted mechanically from `domain/soeng/05_zi.sol` (`tools/dys_fntable.py`, artifact `data/dysnomia/fn_tables.json`). Gate: `public` = anyone · `owners` = MultiOwnable set, **msg.sender OR tx.origin** · `bouncers` = QING bouncer rule · `single-owner` = classic owner · `deployer` = constructor wiring. `meter` = the call self-mints one unit via `_mintToCap()` (a call-counter against the constructor-lottery `maxSupply`).

| signature | gate | meter | events | reverts |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `constructor(address ChoaAddress)` | deployer | meter | — | — |
| `Spin(uint256 QingWaat) returns (uint256 Iota, uint256 Omicron, uint256 Omega, uint256 Eta)` | public | meter | — | — |
<!-- fntable-end -->

Effects: `Spin` — full ladder recompute + 2 modExps + 2 quotient reads; one
meter tick. Requires the caller to have a CHO session (GetUser).

## 6. Integration notes

- `Yuan(currency)` (on CHOA) is what the spins normalize against — see
  [choa.md](/dysnomia/dev/choa).
- Spin returns overwrote Omicron/Omega with post-modExp values — callers that
  want XIE's raw pair should read XIE directly.

## 7. Provenance

- [src] `docs/solidity/dysnomia/domain/soeng/05_zi.sol`.
- [chain] perimeter.
