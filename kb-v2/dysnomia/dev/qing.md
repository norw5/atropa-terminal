# QING — "Mysterious Qing" — the venue token (factory-child TYPE)

> Type doc: 917 live instances `[chain]`, children of [MAP](/dysnomia/dev/map).
> A QING is a chat room + admission economy wrapped around ANY ERC-20.

## In player terms

| | |
|---|---|
| **A room with a door policy** | Each QING is a chat room named after the token it wraps ("<asset> QING"). Getting in (`Join`) means passing the door: be staff, hold ≥25 CROWS, hold a stake of the wrapped asset (total supply ÷ divisor — the divisor is tunable, default 32), own the wrapped contract, be guest-listed (24 hours), or pay the cover charge in the wrapped asset. |
| **Chat that knows who you are** | Venue messages (`Chat`) carry username + soul + aura, so archives are self-identifying. Talking follows the same door rules — no admission, no voice. |
| **The staff run the room** | Bouncers set cover, divisor, staff list, guest list; rates on the venue's desk can only rise (capped). It is a mini-club-management simulator, onchain. |
| **A birth-lottery you can't see** | At creation, one draw decides whether the room's accumulated cover charges can EVER be cashed out (GWAT flag). Most rooms drew "locked" — their escrow is a permanent exhibit; a few drew "free" and their owners can `Withdraw`. |
| **Rooms hold money** | Covers and desk trades accumulate in the QING itself — a locked room's balance is visible forever, extractable never. |

## 2. Role

The venue layer: each QING is a DYSNOMIA token named after its wrapped asset
("<asset> QING", symbol "q<sym>"), carrying venue chat (`Chat` emits
`LogEvent(Username, Soul, Aura, line)`), a bouncer economy (staff list, ≥25
CROWS `0x203e366A1821570b2f84Ff5ae8B3BdeB48Dc4fa1`, asset-stake ≥
totalSupply÷BouncerDivisor, or asset-contract ownership), an optional cover
charge in the wrapped asset, 1-day guest passes, and — decided at creation by
lottery — whether its accumulated escrow can EVER be withdrawn (`GWAT`
immutable flag). The community's visible venue map (FED venue, pWBTC venue,
917 total) is this type.

## 3. Dependencies

- Constructor wires CHO (`Cho`), the wrapped `Asset`, and `Map = msg.sender`;
  staff-seeds `tx.origin`; default `BouncerDivisor = 32` ("Based On Holding
  25 CROWS" `[src comment]`); takes entropy from `Cho.React`.
- Called by: users (Join/Chat/Admitted), CHO.VerifyUserTokenPermissions (via
  Join/Chat), CHOA.Chat (venue chat + bounty), YUE.GetAssetRate walks the
  QING-on-QING derivative chain (`Asset()` of a GWAT QING is another QING).

## 4. State

`Cho`, `Asset`, `Map`, `Waat` (coordinate), `Entropy`, `BouncerDivisor`,
`CoverCharge`, `NoCROWS`, `_staff`, `_list` (guest list with 1-day windows),
`GWAT` (immutable; `true` — escrow locked forever — unless
`Luo % 476733977057179 == 0` at creation: a 1-in-Meridians[0]-ish lottery).

Effects: `bouncer(x)` — the four-way door pass: staff ∨ (≥25 CROWS unless
NoCROWS) ∨ (asset balance ≥ asset.totalSupply ÷ BouncerDivisor) ∨ (asset
MultiOwnable membership if the asset has an owner face).
`_checkBouncer` checks tx.origin, msg.sender AND the tx.origin's LAU
(three-way pass).

**Who passes which gate (practical map)** `[src:
03_qing.sol:32,44-47,59-90; map.sol:82-87]`: after creation the venue's
`onlyOwners` set is CHO + the wrapped asset's owner (MAP adds it when the
asset exposes `owner()`), plus anyone appended later by [DO](/dysnomia/dev/do).Take;
its `onlyBouncers` set is the staff list — **seeded with the creator**
(`_staff[tx.origin] = true` in the constructor) — plus the four-way door
pass above (CROWS / asset stake / asset-contract owner). Practical
consequence: the venue CREATOR can set cover, staff, guest list and divisor
from block one without touching ownership, but cannot touch the owners'
surface (`AddMarketRate`, `Withdraw`, `AllowCROWS`) unless CHO added them,
the asset owner is them, or they Took the venue.

`Join(UserToken)` — the admission flow `[src: 03_qing.sol]`: (1) verify the
LAU through CHO (`VerifyUserTokenPermissions` — the WITHOUT-ban check lives
there); (2) take the cover charge — a transferFrom of the wrapped asset that
needs the caller's allowance set ABOVE the cover (`CoverChargeUnauthorized`
otherwise) — unless the address is guest-listed; (3) grant the 1-day admit
window; (4) if the caller has no CHO delegate yet, enter them (auto-register
with the hub on first venue contact). `Admitted(UserToken)` reads the window
back. `Chat(LAU, MSG)` — refuses if MAP forbids the asset (`Forbidden`),
verifies the LAU, requires an unexpired admission (`NotAdmitted`) or payment
(`PayCover`), then emits the 4-arg `LogEvent`. `Withdraw` — owners-gated,
**asserts !GWAT** (locked venues can never withdraw), pays out + `Withdrawal`
event. `AddMarketRate` — rate can only increase, capped at priced-asset
totalSupply ÷ 777. Rosenfeld additions are pure-view tensor farce over
`(Waat, Entropy, planck=6626)` + staticcall probes of the soeng ladder.

## 6. Integration notes

- Reading venue chat: LogEvents on the QING address (note the 4-arg shape —
  Username string first — DIFFERENT from SHIO's 3-arg LogEvent; decode
  accordingly).
- Admission for a fresh wallet: hold ≥25 CROWS, or ≥ totalSupply÷divisor of
  the wrapped asset, or get staffed/guest-listed, or pay cover.
- GWAT flag check before any UI promises withdrawals: `GWAT()` is public —
  most venues are permanently locked (creation lottery).
- Assets can opt out pre-emptively: their owner calls `MAP.Forbid`.
