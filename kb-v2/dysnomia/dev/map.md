## In player terms

| | |
|---|---|
| **Wrap any token, get a venue** | `New(anyERC20)` — no approval, no payment, just gas — deploys a chat room around that token: the "FED QING" is the room wrapped around the treasury's FED, the "pWBTC QING" around forked WBTC. If a room for that asset exists, it is THE room: one per asset, ever, planet-wide. |
| **Where it lands is a dice roll** | The venue's map position comes from CHO's coordinate lottery fed through HECKE's grid — you choose the asset, the world chooses the address. Tile collisions revert the whole create (gas spent, no venue). |
| **Token owners can veto** | A token's owner can `Forbid` it in advance — no venue may wrap it. (And anyone holding the WITHOUT ban token makes the read-path report a token as forbidden.) |
| **Still an open factory** | 917 venues and counting; treasury-side actors are among the most prolific creators `[chain]`. |
| **One leak to know about** | If a create reverts late (e.g. tile collision), the coordinate it drew stays claimed in CHO forever — the map keeps a small permanent scar from every failed attempt. |

## 2. Role

The venue layer's factory: `New(asset)` wraps ANY ERC-20 into a
[QING](/dysnomia/dev/qing) — one per asset, ever — placed at a coordinate derived from
`CHO.Luo() × Offset` (Offset = `Meridians[0]`) through the [HECKE](/dysnomia/dev/hecke)
transform. MAP also keeps the three venue indexes (asset → QING, Waat → QING,
(lat,lon) → QING — the last asserted collision-free) and the per-asset
forbid list.

## 3. Dependencies

- Constructor wires CHO + HECKE; adds itself as owner of CHO and VOID.
- Called by: anyone for `New`/`Forbid` (QING creators include the treasury
  actors — 0x6e8e8007… ×68, cDc slot 0xce28607b… ×22, helpers builder ×7
  `[chain]`); QING constructor calls back (`Map = MAPINTERFACE(msg.sender)`).

## 4. State

`Cho`, `Map` (HECKE), `Offset` (= Meridians[0] = 476733977057179 `[chain]`),
`_qings` (asset → QING), `_waats` (Waat → QING), `_forbidden` (asset → bool),
`_map` (lat → lon → QING).

## 5. Functions

<!-- fntable: MAP @ domain/map.sol -->
<!-- fntable-begin: MAP @ domain/map.sol -->
Function table extracted mechanically from `domain/map.sol`. Gate: `public` = anyone · `owners` = MultiOwnable set, **msg.sender OR tx.origin** · `bouncers` = QING bouncer rule · `single-owner` = classic owner · `deployer` = constructor wiring. `meter` = the call self-mints one unit via `_mintToCap()` (a call-counter against the constructor-lottery `maxSupply`).

|---|---|---|---|---|

| `addToMap(uint256 Waat, address Qing)` | internal | — | — | `assert` |

Effects: `New(Integrative)` — the venue-creation pipeline, in order
`[src: domain/map.sol]`:

1. Rejects duplicates (`QingAlreadyExists`), assets forbidden by their own
   side (`ForbiddenToken`) and anything that is itself a QING
   (`DerivativeQing` — detected by exposing `Waat()`; no venues-on-venues).
2. Draws the placement: `Luo = Cho.Luo() × Offset` (Offset = `Meridians[0]`
   — one draw per venue ever, claimed in CHO's `Qu` map).
3. Deploys the QING; if the wrapped asset has `owner()`, the asset owner
   joins the new venue's owner set.
4. Renames it `"<asset> QING"` / `"q<symbol>"`; cross-owns with CHO.
5. Registers all three indexes — asset → QING, Waat → QING, and the tile via
   `addToMap`, which **asserts the (lat,lon) tile is free** (the late-revert
   collision site; see the leak note below).
6. Sets the QING's own market rate 1:1 and emits
   `NewQing(Qing, Integrative, Waat)` — **args NOT indexed** (decode from
   data words `[chain]`).

`Forbid(Token, Disallow)` — permitted to the asset's classic owner
(`owner()` == msg.sender) or a MultiOwnable owner (`NotOwner` otherwise);
note `Forbidden(view)` returns true for ANY caller holding WITHOUT — the ban
token doubles as a global venue-asset veto on the read path.

Ownership note for creators `[src: map.sol:80-87 + 03_qing.sol:30-32]`: a
new QING's owners are CHO, the wrapped asset's owner (when the asset has
`owner()`), and later DO.Take adders — NOT the creator. The creator is
auto-staffed instead (`_staff[tx.origin]`), which covers every bouncer
function (cover charge, staff, guest list, divisor). See the gate map in
[qing.md](/dysnomia/dev/qing) §5.

## 6. Integration notes

- Wrapping a token: approve nothing — `New` needs only gas; the QING's
  admission economics come from its own bouncer settings.
- One-QING-per-asset is global and permanent; a reverted `New` (e.g. tile
  collision in `addToMap`) rolls back MAP but NOT CHO's side: the `De` drawn
  by `Cho.Luo()` stays claimed in CHO's `Qu` map forever (cross-contract
  state — a slow leak that complements the 988-creates-vs-917-live delta).
- Tile collisions assert — with HECKE's anisotropy, dense regions make some
  `New` calls revert after paying the lottery gas.
